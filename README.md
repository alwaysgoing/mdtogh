#Markdown to Github Html

##Motivation

Basically, You may want to convert md files into Html looks exactly like github does.

Maybe you would try pandoc, but html it generates looks not very well.

So, I start writing this small tool, inspired & based on [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip)

##Feature

*	toc support
*	looks exactly like github pages

##Current

mdtogh is on hard developing. Plz wait for first version.
